# C++ Reflection Example

small example of a class (Person) in which the reflection system defines the 
types and prints it to the console along with its values. Some of the benefits to
a reflection system is obviously realtime type detection in which would can be used 
for a flexible serialization system.

This project was created because I wanted to learn how reflection in c++ works. 
Another reason is my game engine that I'm currently working on requires some 
reflection system.

# Build

you want.
